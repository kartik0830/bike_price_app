🏍️ Bike Resale Price & Profit Prediction App

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts the resale price of a used bike and calculates the expected profit or loss based on the buying price.
The model is trained using XGBoost Regressor and deployed as an interactive Streamlit web application.

📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains used bike listings with the following features:

🔹 Input Features

Brand – Manufacturer of the bike

Owner – Ownership count (First, Second, etc.)

Kilometers Driven – Total distance traveled

Age – Age of the bike in years

Power – Engine power (CC)

🔹 Target Variable

Price – Resale price of the bike

Duplicate records were removed to improve data quality, and high-cardinality features such as city names were excluded to prevent overfitting.

🛠️ Tech Stack
